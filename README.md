SimpleHasher - a webpage that hashes strings wherever you may be
----------------------------------------------------------------

You give it a string, it gives you the hash. That's all.

A longer description:

It uses Javascript to hash things on the client-side, and you can just save the webpage to your mobile device or computer, or use it online, or anything. The website is available here on github at <anotherkamila.github.com/hash>.
