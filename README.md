SimpleHasher - a webpage that hashes strings wherever you may be
----------------------------------------------------------------

You give it a string, it gives you the hash. That's all.

A longer description:

It uses Javascript to hash things on the client-side, and you can just save the webpage to your mobile device or computer, or use it online, or anything. The website is available here on github at <anotherkamila.github.com/hash>.

Currently it only support SHA-256, since I created it only for personal use and I haven't needed anything else so far. If you want it to support more, feel free to submit an issue.
